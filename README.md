# Scorigami
College Football Scorigami is the accumulation of all college football scores since 1869. 100k+ games at the time of this writing. I created this to visualize that data, and allow people to analyze it to find unique scores by their favorite team!

You can check out the website using this very Django code here: https://www.cfbscorigami.com/home/

Note: new scripts were built to update the database as new scores occur, as well as tweet for scorigamis, follow my twitter for College Football Scorigami updates!
